# Breadth First Search with Nvidia Cuda

* This implementation of the Breadth First Search is based on the paper [**Accelerating Large Graph Algorithms on the GPU
Using CUDA**](http://www.nvidia.co.uk/content/cudazone/CUDABrowser/downloads/Accelerate_Large_Graph_Algorithms/HiPC.pdf) by Pawan Harish and P.J. Narayanan.
